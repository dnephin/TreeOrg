== bugs ==
- change to editable div instead of inputs for better copy/paste


- animation/effect on open/close parents (maybe highlight or dropdown)
- keyboard events (ctrl events for del, toggle focus, jump to empty)
- validate and sanitize user input
- children of removed nodes are still visible
- add timecreated, etc to model
- tests
- loading notification (spinning something near title?)
- error notification
- look at less
- Can I change Node.children to Node._children and remove transient property, or will that lose children in encode/decode ?

- assign root_node to a name, and create a permission object for that root.
	all children of that root share that permission
