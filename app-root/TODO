== bugs ==

- keyboard events (ctrl events for del, toggle focus, jump to empty)
	 -replace current buttons with a single nicer one with a popup

- loading notification (spinning something near title?) + error notification

- Can I change Node.children to Node._children and remove transient property, or will that lose children in encode/decode ?



- animation/effect on open/close parents (maybe highlight or dropdown)
- use less for css
- Router for urls
- change fetchChildren to be an async call (refactoring)


== before release ==
Model Refactor:
	- add timecreated, etc to model
	- assign root_node to a name, and create a permission object for that root.
		all children of that root share that permission
		- right now children of removed nodes are still acessible from their key
	- restrict reserved model properties



== features ==
- numbers on parent nodes to identify count of children (?) for not yet loaded
- configuration display
- links
- type to find node (ex: sports/hockey/game1/)
- backbone extension
- show long text when focused somewhere?
- markdown
- links
- menu for meta properties (scalar, list, map)
- embed (size controls)
- cavas view of the tree (cache some node structure?)
- uses:
	- wiki
	- blog
	- informational store
	- 
- dates as standard field
- button to move task to google calendar
- move items up and down in the list
